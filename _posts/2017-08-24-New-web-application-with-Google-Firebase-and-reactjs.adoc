= New web application with Google Firebase and react.js

I had the idea to create a web application. May idea was to start quickly and not spending time with setting up and configuring servers. After some reading I decided to go with Google Firebase and using react.js for the frontend. So far, I have almost no experience with javascript. Thus, this little project will hopefully help me to get some experience with java script and react.js framework.

I chose Google Firebase as it provides some great feature, like realtime database, hosting of the entire web app as well as cloud functions to implement some backend code. And I wanted to try it out;-)

In the coming blog posts I will report about my experience regarding the setup and the configuration of the tools as well as my progress.
